# OpenCV
> Some quick and dirty "week end" projects over reading break 2019

## Status 
This repo is temporary deprecated, as reading break has ended. I will re-continue when I start cmpt 412 (CV) and cmpt 414 (model based CV)
In the mean time, I am focusing on Deep Learning and Finance. My CNNs can be found [here](https://github.com/alik604/notebooks)  

## Contents

1. Find an Ali. Used this [educational source](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/?completed=/mog-background-reduction-python-opencv-tutorial/)
> Facial recognition using a [HAAR cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) (Very basic)

2. License Plate OCR

> Given an image of a License plate, Output all the text found. 
>
> I failed to process the image in a way such that pyTesseract-OCR will work consitantly; works ~70% of the time
